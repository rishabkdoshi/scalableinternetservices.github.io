        <h2>Course Description</h2>

        <p>This course explores advanced topics in highly scalable Internet services and
        their underlying systems architecture.

        Software today is increasingly being delivered as a service: accessible globally
        via web browsers and mobile applications and backed by millions of servers.

        Modern frameworks and platforms are making it easier to build and deploy these
        systems, such as Ruby on Rails and Amazon's EC2.
        </p>
        <p>
        Yet despite these advances, some concerns just don't go away.  Building scalable
        Internet services today still requires an understanding of topics like caching, load
        balancing, security, and monitoring.  In this course we will examine these topics
        and more: the state of the art in building scalable Internet services.

        <h2>Course Project</h2>
        <p>
        The goal of the course project is to gain hands-on experience in building and deploying a scalable web service
        on the Internet.  Students will do this using the latest web technologies in order to learn how to tackle scalability and
        fault-tolerance concerns.  Projects
        will be conducted in agile teams, and students will build their own scalable, redundant web site using
        fundamental web technologies and the Ruby on Rails framework.
        </p>

        <p>Project-centric lab will meet every Friday from either 2:00pm to 3:50pm or 4:00pm to 5:50pm in Boelter 2760.</p>
